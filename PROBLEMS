PROBLEMS file for the EPA region 10 dbf utility package.

This file describes problems and that may arise, and possible
solutions.


PROBLEM: The main Makefile fails to build the main executable files,
giving an error similar to:
ld: /usr/lib/libm.a: fatal error: cannot open file for reading

SYSTEMS: Any.

FIX: Edit the main Makefile, changing the value of $MATHLIB from
/usr/lib/libm.a to whatever the full path to the math library is
on your system.  You might also be able to substitute "-lm".


PROBLEM: The library misclib fails to build, with undefined symbol
"getcwd" in file syscwd.c.

SYSTEMS: Any without a getcwd system call, ie, some BSD systems (?).

FIX: Edit misc/syscwd.c to call getwd rather than getcwd, and don't
pass the length, ie, change
    getcwd(buffer,MAXPATHLEN);
to
    getwd(buffer);
This fix is untested (all my systems have getcwd) but might work.


PROBLEM: When passing a very long list of arguments, the programs work
fine from the system prompt, but mess up from the ARC prompt.

SYSTEMS: Any.

FIX: This is caused by the limited length of variables in AML.  The
only solution is to run the program from the system level via &sys.
