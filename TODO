To do list for dbf utility package.
-----------------------------------

Do a full Windows NT release.  This will be possible once we migrate
our GIS shop to Windows NT.

Make the AML drivers use multiple variables for the arguments.
Currently they use a single variable for the entire list of arguments.
When longer than AML's maximum, the program fails.

Make structure file optional in ascii2info for delimited files.

Allow binary data in character items in info2dbf.  Currently dbf2info
allows this, but info2dbf does not.  Ideally, you should be able to
convert a dbf file with binary data to INFO, then back to dbf, and get
exactly what you started with.  The current version of info2dbf,
however, converts binary bytes to '*'.
